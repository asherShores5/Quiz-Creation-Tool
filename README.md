Here are the required next steps that the user needs to follow in order to get this latest version of our application working:
1. Open the repository in a terminal, if you haven't already, and run the following command to get all of the NPM packages:
npm install
2. Next, change the directory to "client", and run the following two commands to get all of the previous React NPM packages.
cd client
npm install
3. Finally, switch back to the root directory and run our new MERN stack using the following commands! Once you run this, the server should open in localhost:3000.
cd ..
npm run dev
